# why I create this folder

- due to I want to control the content of the dashboard, but not all of them I want to display to everyone. so it need
  to be controlled by the user's role.
- Since my front-end is a paid project, and according to the license, only the back-end basis can be provided, so the
  page control needs to be separate to ensure that it can be quickly adapted to other front-end templates in the future
- In this folder, the overall framework is still MVC, but is integrated into the ControlCenter instead of being called
  directly
